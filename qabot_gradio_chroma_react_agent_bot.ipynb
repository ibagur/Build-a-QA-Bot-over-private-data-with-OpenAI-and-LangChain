      "Summary: In epidemiology, prevalence is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seatbelt use) at a specific time. It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied and is usually expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. Prevalence is most often used in questionnaire studies.\n",

      "Summary: The prevalence of circumcision is the percentage of males in a given population who have been circumcised, with the procedure most commonly being performed as a part of prophylactic healthcare, a religious obligation, or cultural practice. Yosha & Bolnick & Koyle (2012) states that the global incidence of circumcision has risen and seems likely to continue to do so during the \"first half of the twenty-first century\".Since 2010, both the World Health Organization and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS have been promoting a higher rate of circumcision prevalence as a prophylaxis against HIV transmission and some STIs, specifically in areas with high HIV transmission and low circumcision rates. According to Hay & Levin, 2012, around 50% of all circumcisions worldwide are performed for reasons of prophylactic healthcare, while the other 50% are predominately performed for religious or cultural reasons.\n",

      "Summary: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, varies in prevalence from nation to nation. Listed here are the prevalence rates among adults in various countries, based on data from various sources, largely the CIA World Factbook.As of 2018, 38 million people are estimated infected with HIV globally.The HIV pandemic is most severe in Southern Africa. Over 10% of all people infected with HIV/AIDS reside within the region. Adult HIV prevalence exceeds 15% in Eswatini, Botswana, and Lesotho, while an additional six countries report adult HIV prevalence of at least 10%. Outside Africa, the highest prevalence rate is found in the Bahamas (3.3%).In absolute numbers, South Africa (7.5 million), followed by Mozambique (2.2 million), India (2.1 million) and Nigeria (1.8 million) had the highest HIV/AIDS number of cases by the end of 2022. While South Africa's large population of HIV-positive people is attributable to its high disease prevalence (17.3%, one of the highest in the world), Nigeria's is lower at 1.3%, with India's prevalence rate at 0.2%. However, countries such as Nigeria with high HIV rates above 1% are classified as having Generalized HIV Epidemics (GHEs) by UNAIDS, while India's prevalence is well below this threshold, with a prevalence lower than the US's and about the same as Spain. \n",

Gender discrimination is a cause of many forms of violence against women, girls and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, but it also has a wider impact.

It is an umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person's will, based on socially ascribed gender differences between females and males. It includes acts that inflict physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty.

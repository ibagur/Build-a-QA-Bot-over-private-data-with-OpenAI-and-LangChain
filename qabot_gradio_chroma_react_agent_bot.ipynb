      "Final Answer: GBV stands for Gender-based violence. It is an umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person's will, based on socially ascribed gender differences between females and males. It includes acts that inflict physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty. Domestic violence, rape, trafficking, early and forced marriage, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation and abuse are some examples of GBV. GBV is deeply rooted in gender inequality and discriminatory gender roles and norms. It occurs in all humanitarian emergencies and is not limited to specific regions or cultures. The term GBV is used to highlight how systemic gender inequality contributes to violence against women, girls, and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity. It reflects unequal power relations and the use of violence to maintain and reinforce gender inequalities. The GBV AoR (Gender-based Violence Area of Responsibility) applies the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) definition of GBV.\u001b[0m\n",
